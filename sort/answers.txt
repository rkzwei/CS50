sort1 uses: bubble sort
How do you know?: By running the reverse500000, it took the longest, an identifier of the bubble sort handling the end of the list poorly

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: It ran faster than all of the other sorts in every big number scenario

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: it ran rather poorly all around and particularly horrible in the already sorted scenario, meaning it was iterating when it didn't need to, something the bubble wouldn't do
