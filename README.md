# This is my repository, an asynchronous copy of all the CS50 projects done up until the last pushed commit.


# There is a lot of good stuff in there but specifically Finance and DNA have the most exposure to all areas of the course.

# I learned Computer Science as a whole although more specifically, I've become very familiar with the following:

# C
# Python
# SQL
# JavaScript
# Flask
